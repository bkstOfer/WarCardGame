Ive created this app from scratch, using react(18), webpack(5.9) to compile and serve, typescript & styled conponents.
Ive choose to use react hooks to control the app state (instead of redux/redux toolkit) in order to make things abit more diffcult for me. 
* Im only aware to one open issue where there is an undefined network call on game start/restart (it has 0 effect on the application).

- Run install 'npm i'
- Run start 'npm start'
- Or
- Run build 'npm build'
- Lunch index.html from dist folder

  Enjoy ;)
